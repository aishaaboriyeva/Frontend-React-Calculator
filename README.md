# Welcome My Calculator 
Hello, this readme about My Calculator project.
## Task
A calculator is a machine that allows people to perform mathematical operations more easily. For example, most calculators perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Some also do square roots, and more sophisticated calculators can help with calculations and function graphs. Calculators can be found everywhere.

## Description 
The app is written in reactjs about calculator i.e add subtract etc
The application component shows a calculator interface with a display input field and a set of keys for numbers, arihmetic operators, clear,back,and equals.
The UseState hook is used to control the state (result) of the calculator display.
The handleClick function combines the value of the pressed button with the current result state.
The clear function returns the result state to an empty string.
The Backspace function removes the last character from the result position.
## Installation
You must have Reactjs installed on your system to use the app.
You also need to configure the database with the necessary tables and data. Please refer to your database documentation for instructions on configuring your database.
## Usage
 To use the program, you can execute Reactjs code and interact with predefined requests.
 here we are talking about addition and multiplication. for example, if you add 5 + 2 and press the equal sign, the correct answer will be 7, or if you make a mistake in the number 2 and want to write another number, press the c button, if you want to delete everything, press the clear button
 ## The Core Team 
 I complete this project myself.
